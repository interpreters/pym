<h1>PYM - A Macro Preprocessor Based on Python</h1>
<h6>Robert F. Tobler<br>
VRVis Research Center for Virtual Reality and Visualization<br>
Vienna, Austria</h6>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>In a number of tasks the need for a macro preprocessor arises. Most macro
preprocessors, are either syntactically tied to the language they support
(e.g., cpp, the C preprocessor, or the lisp macro facility), or they are
limited in their functionality (cpp), or may even have an arcane syntax (e.g.
m4, chakotay).</p>

<p>We propose a macro preprocessor - PYM - based on the Python scripting
language, which retains the complete expressivity of Python for writing
macros, and thus is not limited by an arcane syntax or a limitation in its
functionality. The complete implementation of this macro preprocessor is a
Python script of around 200 lines of code, and includes the three main
functions of macro definition, macro expansion, and file inclusion. Using
Python's exception mechanism, conditional termination of expansion both on a
per file, and overall level has been implemented. PYM has been shown to be
useful for macro based generation of VRML files, and for macro based
generation of HTML files for a dynamic web server.</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>

<p>macro preprocessor, python tool</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Macro facilities have been introduced to various programming and
defintion languages for a variety of reasons. Among these reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>limited expressive power of the base language (e.g. the WEB system
[Knuth], various assembly languages).
<li>optimization by inline expansion (<tt>cpp</tt> was often used for this)
<li>definition/inclusion of common code sequences
<li>addition of a module structure (e.g. <tt>cpp</tt>)
</ul>

<p>As varied as the reasons for introducing a macro facility to a languages,
are the actual implementations of these facilities. Some macro facilties are
not implemented as preprocessors, but are tightly tied to the language, so
that the macro expansion process is directly integrated into the language
parser. An example for such a macro facility is the LISP macro facility
[Hart].</p>

<p>Most macro facilities are implemented as preprocessors, and are thus
potentially usable not only for the language for which they were designed.
The most well-known example for such a preprocessor is the C preprocessor.
The C Preprocessor is however also tied to its language by the fact, that it
searches the whole input text for symbols to expand, and the arguments to
macros are scanned so that they contain a balanced number of opening and
closing parantheses. Therefore its use as a generalized preprocessor is
limited to languages or texts which have a similar lexical structure to
C.</p>

<p>On the very other end of macro preprocessors are facilties that have no
syntactical relation to any language, and use special tags for starting
definitions of macros and use of macros. An example of such a macro
preprocessor is Chakotay [Probst]</p>

<h3>2. General Operation of a Macro Preprocessor</h3>

<p>There are two main operations of a macro preprocessor:</p>
<ul>
<li>macro definition
<li>macro expansion
</ul>

<p>The well-known C preprocessor, as an example, uses the hash character
<tt>#</tt> as the first non-space character in a line to introduce
preprocessor commands, and defining macros is one of these commands. For
macro expansion, the C preprocessor doesn't use a special macro, it just
scans the input text for lexical symbols as defined by the C language, and
expands these.</p>

<p>Other preprocessors such as Chakotay [Probst] use special characters to
introduce both macro definition and macro expansion. This type of
preprocessor is more generally applicable, as there is no restriction on the
lexical structure of the language or text for which it is used.</p>

<p>In addtion to the two basic operations described above, a third, optional
operation that can be performed by a macro preprocessor is file inclusion. If
we take the C preprocessor as an example again, it introduces the
<tt>#include</tt> command to expand the content of a referenced file in the
output text. This facilitates a modularized structure of coding which may not
be part of the original language that the preprocessor is used for.</p>


<h3>3. PYM operation</h3>

<p>As we needed a preprocessor that can be phased in step by step, one of our
requirements was that it should not change any text without explicit
notification. Thus we decided to mark both macro definition and macro
expansion with special characters or character sequences.</p>

<h4>Macro Definition</h4>

<p>We decided that global Python variables containing strings should be used
in PYM as constant macros, and Python functions returning strings should be
macros accepting arguments. Thus the macro definition phase of PYM is just
the definition of Python globals and Python functions. As Python, with its
indentation based syntax is somewhat line-based, we decided to use a line
based special sequence to introduce PYM macros:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#begin python

#python code for defining "macros" goes here

#end python
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>With these two special sequences it is possible to switch between literal
text that is directly output, and Python code that is executed.</p>

<p>This is however only one part of the functionality. The second one is</p>

<h4>Macro Expansion</h4>

<p>For macro expansion we leave the choice of start and end sequences to the
user. In contrast to the sequences for introducing macro definition, the
sequences for macro expansion can appear anywhere in a line, and the start
and end sequence can be placed on different lines.</p>

<p>Although the starting and ending sequence are user definable, we will use
the defaults for using PYM as a html preprocessor in all examples that will
follow. These two sequences are <tt>&lt;[</tt> and <tt>]&gt;</tt> (i.e.
"special" html tags). With these two sequences defined, and the macro
definition explained earlier we can write our first little PYM example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#begin python
TITLE = "My Web page"
def EXP(e): return str(e)
#end python
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;&lt;[TITLE]&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;[TITLE]&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of 2 raised to the 4th power is &lt;[EXP(2**4)]&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The output of running this through PYM should be obvious:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My Web Page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of 2 raised to the 4th power is 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>For another example of using PYM, see appendix A. Note that we use the
generation of HTML code as a basis for all these examples. This is only due
to the fact that most people understand HTML. The original motivation for
writing PYM were the limitiations in the VRML 2.0 file format for describing
3 dimensional objects. PYM has been successfully used to generate quite
complex VRML code by building on a modularized set of VRML macros.</p>

<h4>File Inclusion</h4>

<p>Now that the main functionality of a macro preprocessor has been covered,
we can think of the one operation that most preprocessors support in
addition: file inclusion. We decided to use a syntax similar to the C
preprocessor for including files:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#include "filename"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>With this addition common code and text can be shared by multiple files.
Although we could have relied on Python's import mechanism, since we are
executing Python code in the macro definition sequences, we decided to make
file inclusion an explicitly supported feature of PYM, so that blocks of text
can be directly included without resorting to the definition of macros.</p>

<h4>Conditional Text output</h4>

<p>A number of preprocessors support conditional text output. As an example
the C preprocessor has the <tt>#if <em>expr</em></tt>, <tt>#elif
<em>expr</em></tt>, <tt>#else</tt>, and <tt>#endif</tt> directives. This is
supported by PYM with the expressions being standard Python expressions.</p>

<p>In addition to this standard mechanism, the following two tricks are
supported, which may be more convenient in some circumstances</p>

<p>The first one of these tricks is <em>computed include</em>: we have made
the filename behind the include statement an actual Python expression. So not
only a direct string but also a function can be used that returns the
filename of the file to be included. Thereby it is possible to include text
based on arbitrary conditions.</p>

<p>The second trick is <em>signalled termination of expansion</em>: whenever
Python code is executed in PYM, either while defining macros or while
expanding macros, one of two exceptions may be explicitly raised by the code
in order to affect PYM output: <tt>PymEndOfFile</tt> or <tt>PymExit</tt>.</p>

<p>Raising <tt>PymEndOfFile</tt> immediately terminates text output of the
current file, continuing expansion at the previous level of file inclusion.
Raising <tt>PymExit</tt> completely terminates text output.</p>

<p>With these two facilities conditional text output is fairly easily
controlled, without too much additional functionality that has to be handled
by PYM.</p>

<h4>Implementation Notes</h4>

<p>Implementing PYM consists of four major parsing tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>scanning for Python macro definitions
<li>including files
<li>conditional output
<li>expanding Python macros
</ul>

<p>The first three tasks are handled by a line based parser, that searches
for blocks of Python code and executes them, for include lines and
recursively expands files, and for if-elif-else-endif sequences and
conditionally outputs the relevant text.</p>

<p>The fourth task is handled by searching for pairs of the begin and end
sequences for macro expansion, and evaluating the expression between these
two sequences as a Python expression. Macro expansion is recursively applied
to the result of each expression until no more special sequences are found.
</p>

<p>The Python code for macro definition, the Python expressions for macro
expansion, conditions, and the computed include file name are all executed in
the same environment that is separate from the global name spaces of PYM
itself. The two exception classes used for termination of expansion are
defined in the global name space of PYM and mirrored in the environment used
for macro definition and expansion, so that they can be used to communicate
between these two execution environments.</p>

<h3>4. Advantages of Python for implementing a macro preprocessor</h3>

<p>Using Python as a base language for PYM had a number of advantages, among
these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Multi-line strings</em>: Often the macros that need to be defined are
blocks of text that need to be directly streamed to the output. Python's
multi-line strings make it possible to simply take the desired text block,
surround it with triple quotes, give it a name by assigning it to a variable
and use it as a macro.
<li><em>the <tt>%</tt> operator for strings</em>: this makes it possible to
take text blocks and easily parametrize them and use them as parametrized
macros.
<li><em>named and default function arguments</em>: with Python's facility for
using named function arguments, and define default argument values, it is
possible to program macros that already have default values for their
parameters, and parameters that need to be overridden can be specified by
name.
</ul>

<p>All of these Python features make PYM a very comfortable macro
preprocessor (see appendix B for a short manual). These are of course also
some of the features that make Python a very comfortable programming
language. A similar extension could be applied to any other scripting
languages, such as Perl for example, but the clear and easy syntax of Python
serves as an additional advantage which makes programming macros, quite a bit
more readable than any other macro lanaguage known to the author (e.g.
compared to M4 [Kernighan], autogen [Korb], and chakotay [Probst]). In addtion
to that, PYM profits from all extensions to python, there is no need to
reimplement a feature specifically for the preprocessor, as PYM has access to
all python features. This of course is an advantage that is not shared by any
dedicated preprocessor.

</p>

<h3>5. Implementation Issues</h3>

<p>Executing Python code that is embedded into text that is directly streamed
to the output results in an offset between Python's notion of what the line
number is and the actual line number in the file. When errors in the Python
code are encountered, wrong line numbers will therefore be reported. In
addtion to that Python does not know about the file name where ther error
appeared.</p>

<p>In order to fix this, the exceptions for various errors are caught by PYM
and the linenumber anf filename fields in these exeptions are corrected
before they are reraised. This would be a straightforward job, if every
exception in Python had a linenumber and a filename field. However this is
not the case: some Python exceptions do not have linenumber and filename
fields.</p>

<p>For this reason PYM is not able to report the linenumber and filename in
which an error occured reliably. I consider this to be a small shortcoming of
Python, as every Python exception should just contain a filename and
linenumber field, so that this kind of operation can be easily
implemented.</p>

<h3>6. Conclusions and future work</h3>

<p>A macro preprocessor based on the Python language - PYM - has been
introduced, that makes it possible to use Python for defining macros for
arbitrary other languages or text files. With the full expressivity of Python
at hand this preprocessor simplifies the definition of macros, and increases
the readability of macro code.  Another nice feature of PYM is its compact
implementation (see appendix C) of less than 200 lines of code.</p>

<p>Due to the compactness of PYM, issues such as security and conditional
expressions are left (or not left, since the ?: operator is missing) to
Python.</p>

<p>The performance of PYM has not been investigated, and since the two
parsing tasks of finding Python code blocks, and Python expressions are
handled by functions written in Python it is not expected to be
overwhelmingly high. The main target of PYM was readability, and thus the
performance was never under consideration. If there is enough demand for a
faster PYM parser arises, these two functions are the obvious targets for
optimization, and possible reimplementation in C.</p>

<p>The applicability of PYM to various problem has been verified by
generating rather complex VRML code with it, and by implementing a

<h3>Appendix A: A small Example for using PYM</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to generate a HTML page with numbered chapters and
figures. The whole functionality can be placed into a file
<tt>number.pym</tt> that can be included by any HTML file:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#begin python
NUMBER_MAP = {}

def NUM(tag):
    num = NUMBER_MAP.get(tag, 0) + 1
    NUMBER_MAP[tag] = num
    return str(num)
#end python
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This could be used in a file <tt>page.html</tt> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
#include "number.pym"
 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;[NUM("h4")]&gt; Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure &lt;[NUM("fig")]&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;[NUM("h4")]&gt; Why do we number Chapters?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;[NUM("h4")]&gt; Why do we number figures?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure &lt;[NUM("fig")]&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Subjecting this example to PYM by typing <tt>pym page.pym</tt> results in
the following output:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
 
&lt;h4&gt;1 Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2 Why do we number Chapters?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3 Why do we number figures?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Appendix B: A short PYM manual</h3>

<p>Pym is a command line tool invoked by:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
pym <em>[options]</em><em>filename</em>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This subjects the file <tt><em>filename</em></tt> to macro expansion and
putting the result on standard output. Although PYM does not prescribe a
specific extension, we conventionally use <tt>.pym</tt> in order to indicate
that a file needs to be run through PYM.</p>

<p>Currently PYM only understands one option: <tt>-I <em>directory</em></tt>,
which appends the given directory to the Python include path
<tt>PYM_PATH</tt>. If the directory is given by a relative path, it is taken
to be relative to the call directory of PYM. The includ option can be used
multiple times to append multiple directories to the include path</p>

<p>As a file is run through PYM, each sequence of Python code surrounded by
the following two lines is executed:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#begin python
<em>python-code</em>
#end python
</pre></blockquote>

<p>For each line in <tt><em>filename</em></tt> of the following form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include <em>file-name-expression</em>
</pre></blockquote>

<p><tt><em>file-name-expression</em></tt> is evaluated as a Python
expression. The resulting string is taken as a filename to be streamed to the
output instead of the include line. The included file is recursively
subjected to all rules for macro definition and macro expansion. Note that a
filename surrounded by double quotes is a valid Python expression, and can
thus be used to include a file:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include "<em>file-name</em>"
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In order to find the file specified in the include statement, the file is
first searched locally relative to the including file. If this fails, the
directories in the Python include path <tt>PYM_PATH</tt> are checked, one by
one, until a match is found. Finding no matching file, is currently handled
silently</p>

<p>In order to facilitate conditional text output and conditional macro
definition, the following syntax is supported (note that you can have any
number of <tt>#elif</tt> blocks, including none):</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#if <em>python-expression</em>
text block
#elif <em>python-expression</em>
text block
#else
text block
#endif
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Each of the python-expressions is evaluated, and if the result is true, the
following block is routed to output. If the result is false, the following
text block is suppressed, and Python code inside the text block is not
executed. The block following the <tt>#else</tt> block is routed to output if
the previous block was suppressed.</p>


<p>All other text in <tt><em>filename</em></tt> is subject to macro expansion.
Each sequence of the form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;[<em>python-expression</em>]&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Is replaced by the result of evaluating
<tt><em>python-expression</em></tt> and recursively replacing such sequences
by their expanded output. Note, that this recursive expansion is not applied
to sequences that are shorter than the sum of the length of the two character
sequences that start and end the expression (<tt>&lt;[</tt>, and
<tt>]&gt;</tt>, in total 4 characters), thus it is also possible to generate
these two sequences, if each one of them is the result of a complete
python-expression. The recursive process is only performed on each of the
results of a python-expression individually, the concatenated string of the
results is left unchanged.</p>

<p>Within any Python code executed, the two special strings starting and
ending a python-expression can be set to new strings with the following
sequence:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
PYM_EXPRESSION = ("<em>start-sequence</em>", "<em>end-sequence</em>")
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the output should be placed in a file instead of just be printed on
standard output, the extension of a result file can be specified in any Python
code executed:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
PYM_EXTENSION = "<em>output-extension</em>"
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Within any Python code executed, the output for the current file can be
terminated by the following statement:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
raise PymEndOfFile
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Within any Python code executed, the output can be completely terminated by
the following statement:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
raise PymExit
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The search path for include files can be extended in any Python code
executed by:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
PYM_PATH.append("<em>directory</em>")
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Appendix C: Using PYM with an http-server</h3>

<p>A nice application of PYM is the dynamic generation of html pages, based
on PYM sources. In order to faciltate that, PYM checks for the existence of
the environment variable <tt>DOCMENT_ROOT</tt> which is part of the standard
http server interface. The environment variable <tt>PATH_TRANSLATED</tt> is
used to locate the file that has been requested from the http server. The
<tt>DOCUMENT_ROOT</tt> is also appended to the <tt>PYM_PATH</tt> so that PYM
file inclusion starts searching files in a well defined place. By telling the
server to filter each file with extension <tt>.pym</tt> through the PYM
command, it is possible to implement a whole web-site based on
pym-macros.</p>

<p>As an example, in order to configure the apache web server
(http://www.apache.org/), so that each file with extension <tt>.pym</tt> is
filtered through the PYM command, add the following directives, in the
respecitve places in <tt>httpd.conf</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    DirectoryIndex index.pym index.html
    ...
    AddType application/x-httpd-pym .pym
    ...
    Action application/x-httpd-pym /cgi-bin/pym.py                                  
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Appendix D: The source code of PYM</h3>

<p>The source code to PYM 1.0 as of January 15th, 2001, is actually less than
200 lines long. As a reference you can find all of PYM at <a
